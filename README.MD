# Online Book Store Application
- The Online Book Store is a simple web application that allows users to browse, search, and order books online. This application is built using the Spring Boot framework to create a RESTful API for managing books in an in-memory database. 
- Users can interact with the API using cURL or any other HTTP client.

# Features
- Get a list of all books in the store.
- Get details of a specific book by its ID.
